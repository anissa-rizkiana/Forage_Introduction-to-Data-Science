The task 1 questions:

1. *Across locations, how many apples were purchased in cash?*
2. *How much total cash was spent on these apples?*
3. *Across all payment methods, how much money was spent at the Bakershire store location by non-member customers?*

I use pivot table to answer those questions: Task 1/supermarket_transactions_task 1_answer.xlsx and the example answer from Forage use formula: Task 1/Task 1 - Example Answer - Spreadsheet.xlsx but the results are the same.
