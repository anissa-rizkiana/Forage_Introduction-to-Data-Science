The task 1 questions:

1. *Across locations, how many apples were purchased in cash?*
2. *How much total cash was spent on these apples?*
3. *Across all payment methods, how much money was spent at the Bakershire store location by non-member customers?*

I use pivot table to answer those questions: https://github.com/anissa-rizkiana/Forage_Introduction-to-Data-Science/blob/4641acca2f081f639c245f42d1fef31a5472bf85/Task%201/supermarket_transactions_task%201_answer.xlsx and the example answer from Forage use formula https://github.com/anissa-rizkiana/Forage_Introduction-to-Data-Science/blob/4641acca2f081f639c245f42d1fef31a5472bf85/Task%201/Task%201%20-%20Example%20Answer%20-%20Spreadsheet.xlsx but the results are the same.
